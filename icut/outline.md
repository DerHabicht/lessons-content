1. OP-1: Introduction to CAP Communications
    1. Radio channels
        1. Regulated by NTIA
        2. Assigned by USAF
    2. Normal comms
        1. Might stop working
        2. Radios need to be reliable
    3. How do we use radios?
        1. Simplex Operation
            1. Send and receive on the same frequency
            2. Line of sight transmissions
            3. VHF
        2. Repeater Operation
            1. Send on one frequency, receive on another ("Duplex")
            2. Intermediate transceiver relays messages
            3. Extends range of operation
            4. Still line-of-sight, we just have the advantage of a tall object
            5. VHF
        3. HF Operation
            1. Beyond line-of-sight communication
            2. Operation is dependent on solar weather
            3. Might have to change frequencies throughout the day
            4. Communication won't be as clear as on VHF
            5. Probably will need a larger antenna
    4. Communications Security
        1. The exact frequencies we use are UNCLASS//FOUO by USAF
        2. Instead of frequencies, we use channel designators
            1. NHQ channel designators are 3 letters and start with "NR" or
            "NN" e.g.:
                1. NRA
                2. NRB
                3. NRC
                4. NRD
            2. NNA--NNU are for Automatic Link Establishment (ALE)
            3. Region HF frequencies: region designators plus A--J:
                1. NE: Northeast Region
                2. ME: Middle East (Mid-Atlantic) Region
                3. GL: Great Lakes Region
                4. SE: Southeast Region
                5. NC: North Central Region
                6. SW: Southwest Region
                7. RM: Rocky Mountain Region
                8. PC: Pacific Region
            4. VHF Frequencies have names such as "CAPGAURD" or "TAC 1"
            5. VHF Repeaters have "R" followed by two letters:
                1. Even numbers use the same frequency pair as other even
                numbers
                2. Odd numbers use the same frequency pair as other odd numbers
                3. Differentiation is the "squelch tone"
    5. Reliability requirements
        1. Commercial infrastructure can be compromised by big events
        2. Infrastructure degradation, too many users, or too much information
        causes a "stressed communications environment."
        3. "You fight like you train, [so train like you fight]." - Gen. Patton
        4. Cell phone use is not permitted in flight except in emergency.
    6. Liaison Communications
        1. Any time we communicate with other agencies or groups
        2. Special arrangements have to be made in advance
        3. Follow the instructions you receive from the mission Communications Unit
        Leader or activity Communications Officer
        4. CAP is a "secondary user" on some frequencies
            1. This means that other agencies can use our channels and might
            even have priority
            2. Do not interfere with comms you don't recognize. Be ready to
            assist, and report to Communications Officer or Communications Unit
            Leader
    7. Amateur Radio
        1. FCC governs communications conducted by private organizations or by
        state and local governments
        2. NTIA governs communications conducted by federal agencies
        3. Amateur Radio is an FCC-regulated "radio service." CAP is an
        NTIA-regulated service. A hard line between these services exist by
        fiat of congress (some exceptions apply).
        4. Amateur Radio cannot be used for CAP business or on CAP time.
        5. Other banned services include CB, GMRS, and MURS.
        6. FRS may be used for training, but NOT for missions.
2. T-1: Operation of the EF Johnson 5317/5117/5112 radios
    1. CAP issues/uses 4 VHF radios:
        1. EF Johnson 5317
        2. EF Johnson 5112/5117
        3. Motorola APX 4000
        4. Motorola APK 4500
    2. EF Johnson 5317
        1. Channels
            1. The 5317 can store at least 256 channels
            2. Organized into 16 zones of 16 channels apiece
            3. When talking about tuning of the 5317, you need to say "Zone X,
            Channel Y"
        2. Scanning
            1. The 5317 can automatically switch between channels, stopping
            when it hears communication on a channel this is called "scanning"
            2. Usually, a better way to monitor multiple channels is to use
            multiple radios with assigned or designated operators
        5. Safety
            1. Power to radio
                1. If you noticed frayed cords, excessive heat, or if the
                "magic smoke" is coming out of the radio, turn it off, unplug
                it, and let the Comms Officer, or CUL know.
                2. The radio itself doesn't have enough power to actually
                electrocute you, but it can start a fire and getting zapped is
                unpleasant
                3. Base stations typically use a "linear power supply." Be
                careful with any exposed metal contacts
                4. Keep radio out of the rain, do not use next to a pool, and
                keep radio away from beverages and salivating St. Barnard dogs
            2. RF Energy
                1. Recognize how to connect the radio
                2. Operating a radio without the antenna attached could damage
                it, so don't do it
                3. Keep clear of antennas
                    1. Transmission at high enough power (which we don't
                    usually use, but don't make assumptions) can cause "RF
                    Burns."
                    2. Touching an antenna that is connected to a radio can
                    deliver a very unpleasant, if things go very wrong, a
                    lethal shock.
        6. Controls
            1. On/Off by pushing knob
            2. Turn knob to adjust volume
            3. Display shows designator, zone, and channel
            4. Push select switch to switch between zone and channel
            5. Turn knob to select channel
            6. A line will appear over the position that the select switch will
            affect
            7. The following buttons are CAP-standard
                1. TX PWR
                    1. Toggles High Power and Low Power
                    2. General rule is to use lowest power necessary to
                    complete communication
                    3. In reality, we rarely ever fiddle with this
                2. SCAN
                    1. Toggles Scan function
                    2. A "clock face" appears between zone and channel
                3. SCN ED
                    1. Edits the "scan list"
                    2. Don't worry about it
                    3. If you accidentally push it, just push it again to turn
                    off the scan edit function
                    4. Don't use functions you are not trained to use lest you
                    incur the wrath of the Comms Officer
                4. SEL SQ
                    1. Toggles between normal squelch and selected squelch
                    2. Selected squelch will not open the squelch without the
                    proper CTCSS tone
            8. The other two buttons are for encryption
                1. Encryption is not covered in T-1
                2. We don't use it in UTWG anyway
                3. Don't use features you're not trained to use lest you incur
                the wrath of the Comms Officer
        7. Operation
            1. Microphone Plug
                1. Connector is indexed, if it isn't going in, rotate it don't
                force it
                2. Microphone connector has a locking collar, pull back on the
                collar to connect/disconnect
                3. Do not pull on the cord
            2. Before transmitting
                1. Check channel
                2. Check TX PWR
                3. Turn off SCAN
                4. SEL SQ should be in Selective
                5. Always listen before transmitting
            3. To transmit
                1. Push the PTT
                2. Hold microphone 1--2 inches from mouth (talk across not
                into)
                3. Speak in a normal voice
                4. Release switch as soon as you finish talking
            4. Microphone hang-up bracket
                1. Slip button on back of mic into bracket
                2. Hanging up the microphone in a vehicle may prevent a safety
                problem
                3. At a base station, you'll probably leave the microphone down
                to indicate which radio you're using (or you'll have a desk
                mic)
    3. EF Johnson 5112/5117
        1. This is a portable/handheld radio
        2. Channels
            1. Organized into 16 (or more) zones of 16 channels apiece
            2. When talking about tuning of the 5117, you need to say "Zone X,
            Channel Y"
        3. Scanning
            1. The 5117 can automatically switch between channels, stopping
            when it hears communication on a channel this is called "scanning"
            2. Usually, a better way to monitor multiple channels is to use
            multiple radios with assigned or designated operators
        4. Battery
            1. The 5117 Uses a rechargeable battery
            2. Each 5117 comes with a charging cradle that plugs into a wall
            outlet
            3. To charge, turn radio off and insert into base, and verify
            charging light turns yellow
            4. Light will turn green when it is charged
            5. Full charge takes about 3 hours
            6. Do not transmit while charging
        5. Safety
            1. Battery
                1. Try to keep radio dry
                2. Do not let metal objects come in contact with the charging
                contacts
                3. If the battery gets hot, turn the radio off, and report it
                4. Li-Ion batteries are safe as long as you don't
                mutilate/damage them.
                Mutilating/damaging/overcharging/generally abusing one,
                however, will turn it into a very angry firebomb.
            2. RF Energy
                1. Designed to precautionary health/safety standards
                2. Antenna should generally be held vertically
                3. Should generally not be against the skin
            3. Antenna
                1. Getting poked or hit with an antenna is a stupid reason to
                have to fill out a safety report and you are the reason we have
                to do it, you will incur the wrath of the Comms Officer.
        6. Controls
            1. Top Panel
                1. Power/volume knob
                    1. Turn the radio on by turning the knob until you hear a
                    click
                    2. Adjust volume after the click
                2. Channel switch
                    1. Turn channel knob to select channel (zone is set on the
               t     front panel)
                    2. 16 positions, 1 is clock-wise-most position
                    3. Channel designator shows up on the display
                3. A, B, C selector
                    1. Used for encryption
                    2. Encryption not covered in T-1
                    3. UTWG doesn't use it anyway
                    4. Keep it on "A"
                4. Orange button
                    1. Doesn't do anything
                    2. Usually used as an "oh feces" button in police/fire
                    circles
                    3. CAP does not program any button with that function
            2. Front Panel
                1. Up/Down Keys
                    1. Use to select the zone
                    2. Momentary press shows the zone you are currently set to
                    3. Also used for menus
                    4. Don't touch the menus, lest you incur the wrath of the
                    Comms officer
                2. F1/F2 are for menus
                    1. Don't touch the menus, lest you incur the wrath of the
                    Comms officer
                    2. If you accidentally get into the menu, use F1 to get out
                3. F3
                    1. Toggles between high and low power
                    2. General rule is to use the lowest power you can get away
                    with
                    3. We pay more attention to this on handhelds because high
                    power drains the battery faster
                4. F4
                    1. Toggles between Normal Squelch and Squelch Select
                    2. Normal Squelch is based on signal strength
                    3. Squelch Select requires a CTCSS tone to open the squelch
            3. Side Panel
                1. Option Button 1
                    1. Closest to top
                    2. Wing-specific
                    3. In UTWG, this opens the squelch
                2. Option Button 2
                    1. Toggles scan on/off
                    2. When scanning, a "Z" symbol shows up on the display
                3. Option Button 3
                    1. Turns backlight on and off
                    2. Backlight normally turns off after about 4 seconds
                    3. Leaving the backlight on drains power, so leave it off
        7. Operation
            1. Before transmitting
                1. Check channel
                2. Check TX PWR
                3. Turn off SCAN
                4. SEL SQ should be in Selective
                5. Always listen before transmitting
            2. To transmit
                1. Push the PTT
                2. Hold microphone 1--2 inches from mouth (talk across not
                into)
                3. Speak in a normal voice
                4. Release switch as soon as you finish talking
            3. Top Panel LED
                1. Red: transmitting
                2. Green: receiving
                3. Flashing red: low battery
3. OP-2
    1. Prowords
        1. Short for "Procedure Word"
        2. Prowords always have exactly one meaning
        3. Most common prowords:
            1. THIS IS:
            2. OVER: I am done transmitting and I expect a reply
            3. OUT: A reply is neither expected nor required
            4. OVER and OUT is a contradiction, so don't ever do it
            5. ROGER: I have received/understand your transmission
                1. Common (incorrect) alternative is COPY
                2. COPY has a specific meaning in formal traffic which does not
                mean ROGER
            6. WILCO: short for "WILL COMPLY," I received your last
            transmission and will comply with any/all instructions
            7. ROGER WILCO: I'm a hayseed halfwit and I need to have the radio
            taken away from me
            8. AFFIRMATIVE: Yes
                1. In the aviation band, this is "AFFIRM" to avoid
                confusion with "NEGATIVE"
                2. You might hear pilots say AFFIRM instead of AFFIRMATIVE out
                of habit
            9. NEGATIVE: No
            10. WAIT: I have to pause for a few seconds
                1. Common (incorrect) alternative is "BREAK"
                2. BREAK has a specific meaning in formal traffic, so don't use
                it
                3. WAIT is unique to ACP-125. You should generally avoid it if
                talking to other agencies
            11. WAIT, OUT: I have to pause for more than a few seconds, I will
            call you back.
            12. SAY AGAIN: Repeat the last transmission
                1. In ACP-125, REPEAT is reserved for use with Artillery,
                meaning "fire the same shot at the same target again."
                2. Get into the habit of using SAY AGAIN, since a lot of our
                liaison comms is with UTNG Artillery units
            13. READ BACK: Read back the transmission I just sent to you
    2. The Phonetic Alphabet
        1. Developed by ICAO in the 1950s to account for different accents on
        the radio
        2. Adopted by NATO, and therefore ACP-125
        3. When spelling a word, use "I SPELL" with "spelling bee" rules
            1. Say I SPELL
            2. Say the word 
            3. Spell out the word with the phonetic alphabet
            4. Say the word again
        4. Phonetic alphabet includes numbers
